# Amazon Clone

This is an Amazon clone that's made with ReactJS with the use of React-Bootstrap, Stripe, Axios, and Moment libraries. NodeJS and Google Firebase is used to help with the backend and deployment testing.

Stripe was used for building payment flows
Axios to help with the HTTP requests
Moment library to format dates
NodeJS for the backend server
Firebase for the real-time database usage

npm installs (/amazon-clone):
    npm i react-router-dom
    npm i @stripe/stripe-js
    npm i @stripe/react-stripe-js
    npm i axios
    npm i moment
    npm i react-bootstrap

npm installs (/amazon-clone/functions):
    npm i stripe
    npm i express
    nmp i cors

The app also has core features that allows sites like Amazon to have a full E-Commerce functionality.

The src folder contains all the front-end, and the functions folder contains the backend things.

Here are the functionalities that were implemented:
1) Accounts with login
2) Ability to see products with image, name, price, and rating in front page
3) Cart and Checkout features
4) Payment feature (Used the stripe and axios API to implement; use 42 repeatedly for Card info)
5) Order history page

Updates:
- (3/4/2021) Changed certain links that should only be accessed if you're login (redirects users to login)
- (3/5/2021) Added bottom half of Amazon's header
- (3/5/2021) Added a seperate register page

Things that could be added:
- Toast notifications when an item is added to Cart
- Group items with same product id and have a quantity counter instead
- Add Search functionality
- Add drop-down menus for certain options in the header

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
